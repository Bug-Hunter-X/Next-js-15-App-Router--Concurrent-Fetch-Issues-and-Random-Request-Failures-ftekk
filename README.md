# Next.js 15 App Router: Concurrent Fetch Issues and Random Request Failures

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15's App Router related to concurrent fetches.  Under heavy load or with numerous simultaneous requests, some fetches fail without clear error messages.  This repository provides example code that reproduces the issue and a potential solution.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Simulate multiple requests concurrently (e.g., using multiple browser tabs, or a load testing tool).

You'll observe that some requests fail intermittently, even though the API endpoints are functional.

## Solution

The provided solution implements techniques for managing concurrency and handling potential errors more robustly, making the fetches more resilient.
