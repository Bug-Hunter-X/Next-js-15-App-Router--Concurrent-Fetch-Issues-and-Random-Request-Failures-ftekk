In Next.js 15, an uncommon error can occur when using the `app` directory's `fetch` capabilities within a component's `async` function, particularly when dealing with concurrent requests or a large number of simultaneous fetches.  The error manifests as seemingly random failures, where some requests succeed and others fail without obvious error messages, or the failure might be delayed until much later in the execution. The underlying cause can be related to resource exhaustion within the serverless function handling these requests or improper handling of concurrent requests in the data fetching layer.
